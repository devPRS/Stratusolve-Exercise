# Stratusolve Exercise
This exercise evaluates a basic understanding of PHP, jQuery, HTML &amp; CSS. It makes use of the bootstrap UI framework along with the jquery javascript library. All server actions are done in PHP.

### Action
Hi so i did the the test but honestly although many functions gave an indicator that i should just complete the task i really did not find the modules setup in a way that was very SOLID 
as such i altered them and just to make it clearer to read and understand as well as to insure components are easier to update and manage.

as such the structure is 

    * view - index
    * model - model with database in its own folder which here is our txt file
    * controller - a very simple file that handles post requests between the two. this can later be evolved into a restful layer as per abstraction


thank you for the opportunity to test with you. although this was interesting i felt it only highlighted a limited understanding of skills as such in the response mail i share a repo to another 
test i found and did last weekend which highlights maybe a bit better using a framework to help give you a broader view of my skills
